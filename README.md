## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
We wish to empower students with the data to help them narrow down which US city will be most suitable to live in based on their individual requirements. Please note that this problem statement was arrived at through a survey of the students in our data-science class. We are going to meet the needs of our class by analyzing and aggregating various datasets such as weather, housing, economics and job outlook, by US city. The dataset will be focused primarily on the top 50 cities in US by population.
